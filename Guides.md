# Guides
This is a guide on operating DPWT.\
To make the guide simpler, we will use a fake URL at http://www.dpwt.org. **DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THIS WEBSITE.** Just translate this to wherever it is hosted currently.

## Basics

http://www.dpwt.org is the home page.\
On the top of the page is the header. To the left of the header is the name of the website. It is a button to the home page. To the right of the header is the navigation panel. There, you will see links to the specific parts of the website, like account, console, etc.\
The bottom of the page houses the footer. You will seldom use it. It just contains some quick-links and copyright information.

# Account

## Request/Create An Account

First, navigate to the request page. You can either do this by using the `Request Access` link in the footer or by clicking `Request Access Here` right below the login button on the login page. Once on the page, fill out the details needed, then submit. You are done. Now, an admin has to give you permissions so you can log in.

## Login

Click the `Login` button on the header. This will only show up if you are currently logged out. Once on the page, fill out the details needed, then submit. Fater submitting, select the printer you want to use, the press `Select this Printer`.

## Accessing Account Details

**NOTE:** This page is currently being worked on, so there is no way to access it normally. However, you could get to it by going to `dpwt.org/acc` when logged in.\
This page consists of your account data. You can not edit this information. However, if you need to change something, contact an admin. You can also change your password here.

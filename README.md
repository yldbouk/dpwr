Dimensional Printing Web Terminal

## Initial Installation

- Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org)
  
- In order to have a service console console from the web, the xampp control panel will not be used. Instead, a custom application named "NEWCONTROLPANEL.exe" will be used. Administrator privileges are required to control services. It is known for it to be a false positive on many AVs, so make sure to exclude it.
  
- Set System Enviornemnt Variables: "xamppdir" = Root location of XAMPP.

- Place the contents in htdocs in htdocs.

- Create a folder named "uploads" at /console.

- Open the custom control panel and launch Apache and SQL.

- Set to autostart.

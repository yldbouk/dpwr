# DPWT

Dimensional Printing Web Terminal

Management software that allows users to create and manage requests to print on specified 3D printers.\
Future plans include fully automating the printer side of things.

## Getting Started

This guide assumes you have Debian Linux on the hosting computer.

- Install Docker and git: `apt-get install docker git`
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yldbouk/dpwt && cd dpwt`
- Start the containers: `docker-compose up`
- Wait a couple minutes for the containers to install. While you wait, look for a line that looks like `YOUR MYSQL PASSWORD IS:`. Make note of the password that follows.
- Navigate to http://localhost/acc/request.php
- Make an account.
- After making an account, go to http://localhost:81 and log in with the username `root` and the password that you made note of. Navigate the the database named `dpwt` and then to the table named `login_data`. Set the column `permsUsers` to `developer`. (See below for additional permissions.)
- You should be done. Login to the website and enjoy.
